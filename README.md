<h1>Proposal –</h1>

The first step is to submit a project proposal to me.  It should include a working title and description of what you hope your software will do.  Outline your approach.  Where will you start with the project?  Which pieces will be the most challenging?  What structs or classes do you expect to need?  What’s the minimum you hope to accomplish?  If you blast through it, it what ways could you expand the project?

I will respond to your proposal on Slack.  Be sure to check Slack regularly for a message from me.  We will potentially go back and forth until it’s fleshed out enough for you to move foward.

UML Diagram –

After your project proposal is approved, start working on a more formal design of your system.  Submit a UML diagram that includes the names of each struct or class, the member variables and member functions.  Don’t forget to include the types of all parameters and variables, as well as the return types of the functions.  For each variable/function, write a short (1 sentence) description of what it stores/does.

Do not wait for this to be approved before moving on to the next part!  I will respond to the UML as quickly as I can!  Alert me on Slack as soon as you’ve submitted this, so I can look at it!

Psuedocode

Start to make the skeleton version of your project.  Try to keep your project compiling the whole time, even though it won’t work yet.  Write how each function works in psuedocode as comments inside the function.

Test Plan

Write test cases for your functions.  (There will be a video about this).  For each (public) function, think about how you want it to work, and how it could possibly break.

Revised Psuedocode

If I made suggestions on your psuedocode, be sure to fix them and resubmit by May

<h1>Demo –</h1>

Make a video demoing your project!  Show it off!  Talk about your approach, your architecture, any issues you faced along the way, and what you learned from them.  You could write this up as an essay if you prefer.
